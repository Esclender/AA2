# Phase 1: Understanding the Objective

## Success Metrics and Evaluation Criteria

- **Metrics**: Define the specific metrics that will indicate the success of the project. Examples include:
  - Increase in student satisfaction scores by X%
  - Reduction in average consultation time by X%
  - Improvement in resolution rates by X%

  - Answer: To define success, consider these questions:
    - What is the target percentage increase in student satisfaction scores? we expect at least +10%
    - How much should the average consultation time be reduced? user should expend at least 1 - 3 min to solve all his questions.
    - What is the desired improvement in resolution rates? 5% just at start.

- **Evaluation Criteria**: Determine how these metrics will be measured and evaluated. Consider using:
  - Net Promoter Score (NPS)
  - Customer Effort Score (CES)
  - Satisfaction ratings

  - Answer: Let's consider CES, as this metric fits our use cases.

## Stakeholders and Their Requirements

- **Stakeholders**: Identify all stakeholders involved in the project. Examples include:
  - Student Services Team
  - IT Department
  - University Leadership

  Answer: Focus on the Student Services Team as the primary stakeholder.

- **Requirements**: Gather specific requirements and expectations from each stakeholder group. Consider:
  - Performance improvements expected from the chatbot
  - Reporting and analytics needs
  - Integration with existing systems

  Answer: Emphasize reporting and analytics needs for tracking performance.

## Assumptions and Constraints

- **Assumptions**: List any assumptions made about the data or project. Examples include:
  - Data is representative of the student population
  - Satisfaction ratings are accurate and reliable

  Answer:
    - The data collected is comprehensive and accurately reflects student interactions.
    - The satisfaction ratings are a reliable measure of student sentiment.

- **Constraints**: Note any constraints, such as:
  - Budget limitations
  - Timeline restrictions
  - Technical limitations

  Answer:
    - Budget constraints for implementing changes.
    - Timeline constraints related to academic schedules.
    - Technical constraints regarding system integration and data processing.

## Next Steps

- Organize workshops or meetings with stakeholders to discuss and finalize the above information.
- Document the finalized success metrics, stakeholder requirements, assumptions, and constraints.
