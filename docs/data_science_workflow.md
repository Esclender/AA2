# Data Science Workflow Best Practices

## 1. Understanding the Objective
- [x] Define clear business/research questions
- [x] Establish success metrics and evaluation criteria
- [x] Identify stakeholders and their requirements
- [x] Document assumptions and constraints

## 2. Data Inspection
- [x] Examine data sources and formats
- [x] Assess data completeness and quality
- [x] Identify variables and their types
- [x] Check for data imbalances or biases
- [ ] Understand data collection methodology

## 3. Data Cleaning
- [ ] Handle missing values strategically
- [ ] Address outliers and anomalies
- [ ] Fix inconsistent formatting
- [ ] Normalize/standardize as needed
- [ ] Document all transformations

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
- [x] Generate descriptive statistics
- [x] Visualize distributions and relationships
- [x] Identify patterns and correlations
- [ ] Test initial hypotheses
- [ ] Summarize key findings

## 5. Feature Engineering
- [x] Create relevant derived features
- [ ] Apply dimensionality reduction if necessary
- [x] Transform variables for modeling
- [x] Select most informative features
- [ ] Document feature creation logic

## 6. Ethical Considerations
- [ ] Ensure data privacy compliance
- [ ] Address potential biases in data/models
- [ ] Consider broader societal impacts
- [ ] Document ethical decisions
- [ ] Establish responsible AI practices

## 7. Version Control
- [ ] Initialize git repository
- [ ] Create logical branch structure
- [ ] Commit changes with clear messages
- [ ] Document environment dependencies
- [ ] Use .gitignore for sensitive data

## 8. Validation
- [ ] Implement cross-validation strategy
- [ ] Define appropriate validation metrics
- [ ] Evaluate model performance
- [ ] Check for overfitting/underfitting
- [ ] Compare against baseline models

## 9. Project-Specific Notes
### Variables Analysis
- [x] Identified irrelevant variables (ID, Z_CostContact, Z_Revenue)
- [x] Categorized useful demographic variables (Year_Birth, Education, Marital_Status, Income, Kidhome, Teenhome)
- [x] Analyzed behavior and spending variables (Recency, purchase frequencies, product spending)
- [x] Evaluated marketing campaign response variables (AcceptedCmp1-5, Complain)
- [x] Identified potential confounding variables and high correlations

### Potential Data Relationships
- [x] Noted relationship between income and premium product spending
- [x] Identified purchase frequency and recency as indicators of customer activity
- [x] Recognized past campaign acceptance as predictor for future responses
- [x] Documented negative experience impact (complaints)
